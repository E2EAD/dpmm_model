'VehicleTurningRoutePedestrian','While performing a maneuver, the ego vehicle encounters a pedestrian crossing the road and must perform an emergency brake or an avoidance maneuver.'
'VehicleTurningRoute','While performing a maneuver, the ego vehicle encounters a bicycle crossing the road and must perform an emergency brake or an avoidance maneuver. Compared to VehicleTurningRoutePedestrian, the bicycle moves faster and the ego has to brake earlier.'
'BlockedIntersection','While performing a maneuver, the ego vehicle encounters a stopped vehicle on the road and must perform an emergency brake or an avoidance maneuver.'
'SignalizedJunctionLeftTurn','The ego vehicle is performing an unprotected left turn at an intersection, yielding to oncoming traffic.'
'SignalizedJunctionLeftTurnEnterFlow','The ego vehicle is performing an unprotected left turn at an intersection, merging into opposite traffic.'
'NonSignalizedJunctionLeftTurn','Non-signalized version of SignalizedJunctionLeftTurn. The ego has to negotiate with the opposite vehicles without traffic lights. The ego vehicle is performing an unprotected left turn at an intersection, yielding to oncoming traffic.'
'NonSignalizedJunctionLeftTurnEnterFlow','Non-signalized version of SignalizedJunctionLeftTurnEnterFlow. The ego vehicle is performing an unprotected left turn at an intersection, merging into opposite traffic.'
'SignalizedJunctionRightTurn','The ego vehicle is turning right at an intersection and has to safely merge into the traffic flow coming from its left.'
'NonSignalizedJunctionRightTurn','Non-signalized version of SignalizedJunctionRightTurn. The ego has to negotiate with the traffic flow without traffic lights. The ego vehicle is turning right at an intersection and has to safely merge into the traffic flow coming from its left.'
'EnterActorFlow','A flow of cars runs a red light in front of the ego when it enters the junction, forcing it to react (interrupting the flow or merging into the flow). These vehicles are ’special’ ones such as police cars, ambulances, or firetrucks.'
'HighwayExit','The ego vehicle must cross a lane of moving traffic to exit the highway at an off-ramp.'
'MergerIntoSlowTraffic','The ego vehicle must merge into a slow traffic flow on the off-ramp when exiting the highway.'
'MergerIntoSlowTrafficV2','The ego vehicle must merge into a slow traffic flow coming from the on-ramp when driving on highway roads.'
'InterurbanActorFlow','The ego vehicle leaves the interurban road by turning left, crossing a fast traffic flow.'
'InterurbanAdvancedActorFlow','The ego vehicle incorporates into the interurban road by turning left, first crossing a fast traffic flow, and then merging into another one.'
'HighwayCutIn','The ego vehicle encounters a vehicle merging into its lane from a highway on-ramp. The ego vehicle must decelerate, brake, or change lanes to avoid a collision.'
'CrossingBicycleFlow','The ego vehicle needs to perform a turn at an intersection yielding to bicycles crossing from either the left.'
'OppositeVehicleRunningRedLight','The ego vehicle is going straight at an intersection but a crossing vehicle runs a red light, forcing the ego vehicle to avoid the collision.'
